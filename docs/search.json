    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nThe activities and assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. They are designed to follow the Prepare, Practice, Perform format.\n\nPrepare: Includes short videos, reading assignments, and lectures to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.\nPractice: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. the activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.\nPerform: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.\n\n\nLectures (Prepare)\nPart of the class time will be lectures that introduce new concepts or review topics from the preparation videos. Lectures will not repeat everything in the videos, they will instead highlight important and known to be complex concepts and will be supplemented with live coding activities. You are expected to attend every lecture. Lectures will be recorded and made available to students with an excused absence upon request.\n\n\nApplication exercises (Practice)\nA majority of the in-class lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\nIn addition to AEs will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\n\n\nLabs (Perform)\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework (Perform)\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams (Perform)\nThere will be two, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.\n\n\nProject (Perform)\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nYou may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\n\nLate work\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email the head TA before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Professor Meyer know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nClass recording requests\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at INSERT LINK. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355).

To keep the university community’s safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.  Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays."
