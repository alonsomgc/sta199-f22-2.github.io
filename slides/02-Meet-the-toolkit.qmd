# Checklist 

-- Have you made a GitHub account? 

-- Are you on Slack? (If not, this is okay. We will figure this out)

-- Have you reserved a Duke container?

-- Have you filled out the Getting to know you survey? (If not, why not now?!)

# Warm Up Question 

Please think through / write down what each line of code would produce. 

Tip (and good practice): *if you have questions about a function, use ?function.name to pull up the help page!*
