# Checklist

-- Have you made a GitHub account?

-- Are you on Slack? (If not, this is okay. We will figure this out)

-- Have you reserved a Duke container?

-- Have you filled out the Getting to know you survey? (If not, why not now?!)

# Warm Up Question

Please think through / write down what each line of code would produce.

Tip (and good practice): *if you have questions about a function, use ?function.name to pull up the help page!* If the help page is not helpful, look at their examples section and click *Run Examples*.

# Goals for today

-   R and RStudio
-   Quarto Documents
-   More Practice

# What is R and RStudio?

-- R is a statistical programming language

-- RStudio is a convenient interface for R

# Some R essentials

-- **Functions** are (normally) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

# tidyverse

-- The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science.

-- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar.

# Quarto

-- an open-source scientific and technical publishing system

-- publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more

-- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

# How will we use Quarto?

-- Every assignment / lab / project will be given to you and turned in as a Quarto document

-- You will always have a Quarto template document to start with

-- As we get more familiar with R, the more code you will construct on your own

# Try It

Click on the ae-01 qmd file and render it

# GitHub

-- We have set up an account and cloned repos

-- As said on day 1, GitHub is set up for version control (more coming on Thursday)

# General GitHub Tips

-- Stay away from the terminal. If you google for help, skip any methods for using git through the command line.

-- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](happygitwithr.com)

--- Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.

# Self-Check

-- What is version control? Why is it important?

-- What is R vs RStudio?

-- What is Quarto?

# In-Class

Please go to the course website and click on the ae for today. Clone the repo to get started!
